# Project- Business Case : Aerofit - Descriptive Statistics & Probability
üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Aerofit Treadmill Customer Analysis ‚Äì Summary
This project analyzes customer data from Aerofit, a fitness equipment company, to understand which types of customers buy which treadmill models (KP281, KP481, KP781). Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, I performed:

Data Cleaning & Exploration

Outlier Detection

Univariate & Bivariate Analysis (e.g., age, income, usage by product type)

Contingency Tables & Probability Calculations

Customer Profiling & Business Recommendations

Key insights showed that:

KP281 is popular among younger, budget-conscious users.

KP781 is preferred by fit, high-income individuals.

Gender, age, income, and fitness level influence purchase decisions.

The final output includes charts, probability tables, and actionable insights to help Aerofit target the right customers for each product.
